		<member name="area_mask" type="int" setter="set_area_mask" getter="get_area_mask" default="1">
			Determines which [Area3D] layers affect the sound for reverb and audio bus effects. Areas can be used to redirect [AudioStream]s so that they play in a certain audio bus. An example of how you might use this is making a "water" area so that sounds played in the water are redirected through an audio bus to make them sound like they are being played underwater.

		<member name="attenuation_filter_cutoff_hz" type="float" setter="set_attenuation_filter_cutoff_hz" getter="get_attenuation_filter_cutoff_hz" default="5000.0">
			The cutoff frequency of the attenuation low-pass filter, in Hz. A sound above this frequency is attenuated more than a sound below this frequency. To disable this effect, set this to [code]20500[/code] as this frequency is above the human hearing limit.
		</member>
		<member name="attenuation_filter_db" type="float" setter="set_attenuation_filter_db" getter="get_attenuation_filter_db" default="-24.0">
			Amount how much the filter affects the loudness, in decibels.
		</member>
		<member name="attenuation_model" type="int" setter="set_attenuation_model" getter="get_attenuation_model" enum="AudioSpatializer3D.AttenuationModel" default="0">
			Decides if audio should get quieter with distance linearly, quadratically, logarithmically, or not be affected by distance, effectively disabling attenuation.
		</member>
		<member name="doppler_speed_of_sound" type="float" setter="set_doppler_speed_of_sound" getter="get_doppler_speed_of_sound" default="343.0">
			Speed of sound used when calculating doppler effect.
		</member>
		<member name="doppler_tracking" type="int" setter="set_doppler_tracking" getter="get_doppler_tracking" enum="AudioSpatializer3D.DopplerTracking" default="0">
			Decides in which step the Doppler effect should be calculated.
			[b]Note:[/b] If [member doppler_tracking] is not [constant DOPPLER_TRACKING_DISABLED] but the current [Camera3D]/[AudioListener3D] has doppler tracking disabled, the Doppler effect will be heard but will not take the movement of the current listener into account. If accurate Doppler effect is desired, doppler tracking should be enabled on both the [AudioStreamPlayer3D] and the current [Camera3D]/[AudioListener3D].
		</member>
		<member name="emission_angle_degrees" type="float" setter="set_emission_angle" getter="get_emission_angle" default="45.0">
			The angle in which the audio reaches a listener unattenuated.
		</member>
		<member name="emission_angle_enabled" type="bool" setter="set_emission_angle_enabled" getter="is_emission_angle_enabled" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], the audio should be attenuated according to the direction of the sound.
		</member>
		<member name="emission_angle_filter_attenuation_db" type="float" setter="set_emission_angle_filter_attenuation_db" getter="get_emission_angle_filter_attenuation_db" default="-12.0">
			Attenuation factor used if listener is outside of [member emission_angle_degrees] and [member emission_angle_enabled] is set, in decibels.
		</member>
		<member name="max_distance" type="float" setter="set_max_distance" getter="get_max_distance" default="0.0">
			The distance past which the sound can no longer be heard at all. Only has an effect if set to a value greater than [code]0.0[/code]. [member max_distance] works in tandem with [member unit_size]. However, unlike [member unit_size] whose behavior depends on the [member attenuation_model], [member max_distance] always works in a linear fashion. This can be used to prevent the [AudioStreamPlayer3D] from requiring audio mixing when the listener is far away, which saves CPU resources.
		</member>
		<member name="mix_channel_mode" type="bool" setter="set_mix_channel_mode" getter="get_mix_channel_mode" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], the spatializer will mix audio internally for each channel. Otherwise, volume mixing is done in the [AudioServer]. Only has an effect on startup, when the [AudioSpatializerInstance] is created.
		</member>
		<member name="panning_strength" type="float" setter="set_panning_strength" getter="get_panning_strength" default="1.0">
			Scales the panning strength for this node by multiplying the base [member ProjectSettings.audio/general/3d_panning_strength] by this factor. If the product is [code]0.0[/code] then stereo panning is disabled and the volume is the same for all channels. If the product is [code]1.0[/code] then one of the channels will be muted when the sound is located exactly to the left (or right) of the listener.
			Two speaker stereo arrangements implement the [url=https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#stereopanner-algorithm]WebAudio standard for StereoPannerNode Panning[/url] where the volume is cosine of half the azimuth angle to the ear.
			For other speaker arrangements such as the 5.1 and 7.1 the SPCAP (Speaker-Placement Correction Amplitude) algorithm is implemented.
		</member>
		<member name="unit_size" type="float" setter="set_unit_size" getter="get_unit_size" default="10.0">
			The factor for the attenuation effect. Higher values make the sound audible over a larger distance.
		</member>

	<constants>
		<constant name="ATTENUATION_INVERSE_DISTANCE" value="0" enum="AttenuationModel">
			Attenuation of loudness according to linear distance.
		</constant>
		<constant name="ATTENUATION_INVERSE_SQUARE_DISTANCE" value="1" enum="AttenuationModel">
			Attenuation of loudness according to squared distance.
		</constant>
		<constant name="ATTENUATION_LOGARITHMIC" value="2" enum="AttenuationModel">
			Attenuation of loudness according to logarithmic distance.
		</constant>
		<constant name="ATTENUATION_DISABLED" value="3" enum="AttenuationModel">
			No attenuation of loudness according to distance. The sound will still be heard positionally, unlike an [AudioStreamPlayer]. [constant ATTENUATION_DISABLED] can be combined with a [member max_distance] value greater than [code]0.0[/code] to achieve linear attenuation clamped to a sphere of a defined size.
